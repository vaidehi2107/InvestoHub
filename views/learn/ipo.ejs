      <h2>Initial Public Offering (IPO)</h2>

    <p>
      An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is when a private company offers its shares
      to the public for the first time and gets listed on a stock exchange.
    </p>
    <h4>Types of IPOs</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Mainboard IPO:</strong>
        Large, well-established companies listed on NSE or BSE.
        These IPOs usually have higher issue sizes and stricter regulations.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>SME IPO:</strong>
        Smaller companies listed on NSE SME or BSE SME platforms.
        They offer higher growth potential but come with higher risk and lower liquidity.
      </li>
    </ul>

     <h2>Types of Investors in an IPO</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Retail Investors (RII):</strong>
      Individual investors applying for shares worth up to ₹2 lakh.
      Allotment is done via lottery when the issue is oversubscribed.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>HNI / NII (High Net-worth / Non-Institutional Investors):</strong>
      Investors applying for more than ₹2 lakh.
      Allotment is proportional, not lottery-based.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>QIB (Qualified Institutional Buyers):</strong>
      Large institutions like mutual funds, banks, and insurance companies.
      Their participation indicates confidence in the IPO.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Anchor Investors:</strong>
      A special category of QIBs who invest a day before the IPO opens.
      Anchor investment boosts credibility and market confidence.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-muted">
    Strong participation across categories generally reflects healthy demand for an IPO.

      <h2>Grey Market Premium (GMP)</h2>

  <p>
    Grey Market Premium (GMP) is the unofficial price at which IPO shares
    are traded before they get listed on the stock exchange.
    It reflects market sentiment and demand for an IPO.
  </p>

  <p>
    GMP is quoted as an extra amount over the IPO issue price.
    For example, if an IPO has an issue price of ₹100 and GMP is ₹40,
    the expected listing price is around ₹140.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Positive GMP:</strong> Indicates strong demand and positive sentiment</li>
    <li><strong>Zero or Negative GMP:</strong> Signals weak interest or cautious outlook</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    GMP is driven by demand-supply dynamics, overall market conditions,
    and investor expectations around listing gains.
  </p>

  <p class="text-muted">
    GMP is not official or guaranteed — it should be used as an indicator,
    not a decision-making tool.
