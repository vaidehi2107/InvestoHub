     <h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
    <p>
Technical Analysis is the study of price movement to understand how markets behave.
Instead of focusing on a company’s financials, it analyzes how price reacts to
supply, demand, and trader psychology.
</p>

<p>
At the core of technical analysis is the price itself — and every price movement
can be broken down into four key values, known as <strong>OHLC</strong>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>OHLC</strong> represents how a price behaved during a specific time period:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Open:</strong> The price at which the asset started trading</li>
  <li><strong>High:</strong> The highest price reached during the session</li>
  <li><strong>Low:</strong> The lowest price reached during the session</li>
  <li><strong>Close:</strong> The price at which the asset finished trading</li>
</ul>


<p class="text-muted">
Technical analysis is not about prediction — it is about probability and risk management.

    <h2>CandleStick Patterns</h2>
    <p>
Candlestick patterns help traders understand market sentiment
by showing how buyers and sellers behaved during a time period.
They are formed using OHLC data and often signal trend continuation or reversal.
</p>

<h5>1. Doji</h5>
<p>
A Doji forms when the open and close prices are nearly the same.
It indicates <strong>indecision</strong> in the market and often appears
near trend reversals.
</p>

<h5>2. Marubozu</h5>
<p>
A Marubozu has no upper or lower wick, indicating strong momentum.
A bullish Marubozu shows full buyer control, while a bearish one shows seller dominance.
</p>
<h5>3. Hammer</h5>
<p>
A Hammer appears after a downtrend with a small body and long lower wick.
It shows that buyers stepped in after heavy selling pressure.
</p>

<h5>4. Shooting Star</h5>
<p>
A Shooting Star forms after an uptrend with a small body and long upper wick.
It suggests sellers are gaining control and a possible downside reversal.
</p>

  <h2>Volume</h2>

  <p>
    Volume plays a crucial role in technical analysis as it helps confirm
    price movements and market trends. While price shows direction,
    volume reflects the strength behind that move.
  </p>

  <p>
    It represents the total number of shares traded during a specific
    time period. Higher volume indicates strong market participation,
    whereas low volume signals weak interest or uncertainty.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Price up + High volume:</strong> Strong and healthy trend</li>
    <li><strong>Price up + Low volume:</strong> Weak move, possible reversal</li>
    <li><strong>Breakout with high volume:</strong> Higher chance of continuation</li>
    <li><strong>Price down + High volume:</strong> Strong selling pressure</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-muted">
    Volume helps you understand market conviction and validates
    candlestick patterns, trends, and breakouts.

  <h2>Support & Resistance</h2>

  <p>
    Support and resistance are key price levels where a stock tends to
    pause, reverse, or consolidate. These levels are formed due to
    repeated buying and selling behavior in the market.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Support</strong> is a price level where demand is strong enough
    to prevent further decline, while <strong>Resistance</strong> is where
    selling pressure stops the price from moving higher.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Support:</strong> Acts as a price floor where buyers enter</li>
    <li><strong>Resistance:</strong> Acts as a price ceiling where sellers dominate</li>
    <li><strong>Breakout above resistance:</strong> Indicates bullish strength</li>
    <li><strong>Breakdown below support:</strong> Signals bearish momentum</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-muted">
    Support and resistance work best when combined with volume and
    candlestick patterns for confirmation.

      <h2>Indicators</h2>

      <p>
        Indicators are mathematical tools derived from price data that help
        confirm trends, momentum, and potential reversals.
      </p>

      <p class="text-muted">
        Indicators work best when combined with price action and volume.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Moving Averages</h4>
      <p>
        Moving Averages smooth price movement to show the overall market direction.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SMA:</strong> Average price over a fixed period</li>
        <li><strong>EMA:</strong> Gives more weight to recent prices</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-muted">
        Price above MA indicates strength; below MA indicates weakness.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Bollinger Bands</h4>
      <p>
        Bollinger Bands indicate market volatility using upper and lower bands
        around a moving average.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Overbought:</strong> Price near the upper band</li>
        <li><strong>Oversold:</strong> Price near the lower band</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Relative Strength Index (RSI)</h4>
      <p>
        RSI measures momentum to identify overbought and oversold conditions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Overbought:</strong> RSI above 70 indicates buying exhaustion</li>
        <li><strong>Oversold:</strong> RSI below 30 indicates selling exhaustion</li>
      </ul>
